Question:

1. Not sure if i understood bonus scenario correctly. But my interpretation is that CongestionTaxCalculator should be handled outside of the program e.g database? My knowledge of database is fairly rusty but ill do my best to at least having an "skeleton" mock up.
2. assignment does not describe automated test i assume i dont need to implement it?
